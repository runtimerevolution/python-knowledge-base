# Python Unit Onboarding

The onboarding must be curated for the developer, in a way that it includes all the modules that 
are relevant for the destination project/seniority/previous know-how.

1. create a repository in Bitbucket under https://bitbucket.org/runtimerevolution/workspace/projects/TRAIN,
for the developer. The repository name must follow the rule __< runtime username >-onboarding__ 
2. Include a README.md file with the onboarding instructions
   1. use the [onboarding template](onboarding-template.md)
   2. fill in the gaps by copying the modules, from the table below, that are relevant to the template/README.m
   3. choose one or more of the available projects
3. share the repository with the developer
4. the development process must use Git flow
5. [request feedback](https://forms.gle/1uqg4BEbu6fprPan7) once the onboarding process is finished
