# Library Project

Talk to you team leader and try to design a Library project in Django.

## Requirements

User needs to be able to manage Authors, Books, and Genres in the app.

Each Author can have many Books that he/she has written and each book can be included in multiple genres.

The User should be able to view lists of Authors and Books. The Books should be able to be filtered by Author and by Genre

> Optional: You can also have a search bar for Authors and for Books (one for each)

The App should also include a page to view some basic statistics, like the number of Books per Author, or the number of Books per Genre.
Feel free to add your own statistics here.

> Optional: In case Pandas was part of your onboarding, use it to generate the statistics.
