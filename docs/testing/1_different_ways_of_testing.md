# Different ways of testing

## Manual Testing

### Manual Exploratory Testing

This type of testing is just an exploration of the application, relies on discovery, investigation and
learning. It emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility of the individual tester. 

### Manual Testing

In this case, the test suit is a list of all the features, different scenarios, different input types and
the expected results. All the validations are performed by you, the developer, which means that every time
something changes, you need to go over your test suit list and ensure that you get what you'd expect.

## Automated

### Unit Tests

Tests a particular component in your application, this is the smallest piece of code that can be logically
isolated in a system, typically: a function, a subroutine, a method or property.

### Integration Tests

Different domains, modules or components of your application are tested as a whole.
